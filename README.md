# minsearch

Minimalistic text search engine that uses sklearn and pandas.

This is a simple search library implemented using `sklearn` and `pandas`.

It allows you to index documents with text and keyword fields and perform search queries with support for filtering and boosting.

If you want to learn how it was build, watch the ["Implement a search engine" workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMrGK5QgPVE)

## Installation 

```bash
pip install minsearch
```


## Environment setup

To run it locally, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

Alternatively, use pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

## Usage

Here's how you can use the library:


### Define Your Documents

Prepare your documents as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should have the text and keyword fields you want to index.

```python
docs = [
    {
        "question": "How do I join the course after it has started?",
        "text": "You can join the course at any time. We have recordings available.",
        "section": "General Information",
        "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the prerequisites for the course?",
        "text": "You need to have basic knowledge of programming.",
        "section": "Course Requirements",
        "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp"
    }
]
```

### Create the Index

Create an instance of the `Index` class, specifying the text and keyword fields.


```python
from minsearch import Index

index = Index(
    text_fields=["question", "text", "section"],
    keyword_fields=["course"]
)
```

Fit the index with your documents

```python
index.fit(docs)
```

### Perform a Search

Search the index with a query string, optional filter dictionary, and optional boost dictionary.

```python
query = "Can I join the course if it has already started?"

filter_dict = {"course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp"}
boost_dict = {"question": 3, "text": 1, "section": 1}

results = index.search(query, filter_dict, boost_dict)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

## Notebook 

Run it in a notebook to test it yourself

```bash
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```

## File structure

There's `minsearch` folder and `minsearch.py` file in the root. 

The file `minsearch.py` is kept there because it was used in
the LLM Zoomcamp course, where we'd use `wget` to donwload it.
To avoid breaking changes, we keep the file.



## Publishing

Use `twine` for publishing and `build` for building

```bash
pipenv install --dev twine build
```

Generate a wheel:

```python
pipenv run python -m build
```

Check the packages:

```bash
pipenv run twine check dist/*
```

Upload the library to test PyPI to verify everything is working:

```bash
pipenv run twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

Upload to PyPI:

```bash
pipenv run twine upload dist/*
```

Clean:

```bash
rm -r build/ dist/ minsearch.egg-info/
```

Done!
